ABOUT ME - RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 🌊
======
- I have earned my BSc and Integrated Master of Engineering (MEng) in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.tuc.gr/en/home) from the [Technical University of Crete (TUC)](https://www.tuc.gr/en/home). 
- I am currently enrolled in the joint [Neuroscience PhD program of UZH/ETH](https://www.neuroscience.uzh.ch/en.html) and working towards my PhD thesis in the interdisciplinary field of Neuro-AI (intersection of Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence) and Epilepsy research. 
- I am working at the [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html), [UZH](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) and [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html) Zurich, in the [Neuromorphic Cognitive Systems (NCS)](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/ncs.html) group, supervisor: prof. Giacomo Indiveri.
- On my way to become a neuromorph 🧠 and translate my skills to the development of neuromorphic algorithms that tackle pressing biomedical challenges.
- I am highly interested in Applied Machine Learning and data-driven tools that can transform how we understand and treat biomedical conditions.
- My master thesis titled "Delineating the Epileptogenic Zone by Accurately Determining the High Frequency Oscillation (HFO) Area using Classification of the Extracted Features" introduced me to novel epileptic biomarkers, EEG analysis and involved feature engineering and supervised machine learning algorithms. 
  
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ME ⛹🏻‍♀️
======
- 🎸🎼 I love arts in general but above all playing music and singing.
- 🏀 I am a big fan of basketball and used to play since childhood!
- 📸 Wherever I go, I make sure to capture each moment through my lenses, ensuring that every little experience is immortalized. Photography is another long-lasting passion of mine that also goes hand in hand with traveling.
- 🏔 Living in Switzerland has helped me to indulge more in nature and hiking in my free time.
